# NLP-reviews-classifier

This project aims to train a model which will classify hotel reviews as number of stars

## Project setup

- Step 1: Install Git LFS

  - If you haven't already installed Git LFS, you can download and install it from the official website or use a package manager like Homebrew (for macOS) or Chocolatey (for Windows). Refer to the Git LFS documentation for detailed installation instructions.

- Step 2: Clone the Repository

  - To clone a repository with LFS files, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL:

    `git clone https://github.com/Newtoneiro/NLP-review-classifier`

- Step 3: Fetch LFS Files

  - Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the repository directory and run the following command to fetch the LFS files:

    `git lfs pull`

  - This command downloads the LFS-tracked files associated with the repository.

- Step 4: Pull Updates

  - If you've previously cloned the repository and new LFS files have been added or modified, you can pull the updates using the standard git pull command:

    `git pull`
